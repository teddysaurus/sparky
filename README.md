# The intent of this project is to present a 3D printable robot chassis.
# The goal is for the robot to be modular, customizable and affordable,
# but readily useful for robotics research.
# 
# At this stage, please consider the OpenSCAD files to be a STARTING POINT 
# for your robotic design. I will change this qualification when the files
# have been proven and are more complete.
#
# What is very useful today is the set of supporting files that define the 
# dimensions of robotics components. For instance the Arduino standoff layout
# and the D37 motor mount.
